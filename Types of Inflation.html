	<h1>Types of Inflation</h1>

	<p>
		There are six types of inflation.
		They are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Demand-pull inflation</li>
		<li>Cost-push inflation</li>
		<li>Wage Push Inflation</li>
		<li>Imported Inflation</li>
		<li>Core Inflation</li>
		<li>Hyper Inflation</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Demand-pull inflation</h2>

	<p>
		Demand-pull inflation normally happens when the econormy is expanding more quickly than the long-term trend pace of expansion. Businesses will raise prices if demand outpaces supply.
	</p>

	<h2>Cost-push inflation</h2>

	<p>
		This occurs when firms' cost of production rise, causing the aggregate supply to shift to the left. Producing energy and commodity prices may be the source of cost-push inflation.

	<h2>Wage Push Inflation</h2>

	<p>
		Inflation is often caused by rising salaries. This is essentially a mix of cost-push and demand-pull inflation. Businesses incur increased costs as a result of rising salaries, which are then passed on to customers in the form of higher pricing.
	</p>

	<h2>Imported Inflation</h2>

	<p>
		The cost of imports will increase if the exchange rate declines. As a result, this exchange rate effect alone will cause the prices to rise. Additionally, a depreciation will boost demand by making exports more competitive.
	</p>

	<h2>Core Inflation</h2>

	<p>
		Core inflation is one way to measure inflation. This is the rate of inflation that does not include short-term "volatile" components like the cost of food and energy.
	</p>

	<h2>Hyperinflation (> 1000%)</h2>

	<p>
		There is no precise definition, but it is reserved for extreme forms of inflation, typically exceeding 1,000%. Prices typically fluctuate so quickly during hyperinflation that it becomes a daily occurrence, and money's value drops sharply.
